        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <p>
          There are currently three Classes in Destiny 2: Hunter, Titan, and
          Warlock. While none is more powerful than another, they each have their
          own strengths and weaknesses. The most important difference between them
          all are the abilities found within the subclasses and the perk trees.
          <br /><br />
          Each Class has five subclasses: Arc, Solar, Void, Stasis and Strand.
          Within these subclasses are Aspects and Fragments that alter builds as
          well as different Super options. Use the links below to jump to the
          subclass of your choice.
